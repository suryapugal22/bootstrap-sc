                The STEM council has been established to create a systematic approach to healthcare and research in
                India. We are committed to support Ethics committee, Investigational Site, Sponsors and Vendors with
                knowledge, awareness, innovation, technology, and workforce to deliver research activities with improved
                quality

                This platform serves as a non-profit organization to accelerate and promote global research to reach
                India. Post COVID-19 pandemic, the important lesson learned is that every stakeholder in a clinical
                trial needs to be connected through a common means which utilizes technology so that there is lesser
                need to travel the world in search of partners. The goal is to facilitate each entity with the required
                information and tools so that the common goal of patient safety and ethical research is met with
                increased efficiency

                Approach
            </h1>
            <p class="lead">
                Spreading awareness of ethical trials – At the core of clinical trials lies the safety and ethics of
                patients / volunteers taking part in the trial. With ever increasing disease burden, the need for
                research is at its peak. It is hence the time to be aware of conducting research activities ethically,
                safely and with highest quality. Bringing together research professionals, ethics committees, hospitals,
                research organizations and facilitating industry standard training programs, webinars, and self-learning
                tools are some of the means used in spreading awareness of ethical research. We specifically provide
                training and technology support for Ethics committees and sites in India to improve quality and
                efficiency
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                Equip and guide individuals, institutions, investigators, and innovators – There are a variety of ways
                in which we can assist individuals, institutions, and innovators from awareness to execution of complex
                research activities. Our aim to support individuals through learning tools and to make institutions
                research active
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                Engaging with patients, public and caregivers – No research is possible without voluntary participation
                of patients and/or public and the support provided by caregivers. It is important that they are involved
                and informed. We are taking that extra mile to bring clinical trials to patients and public by being a
                platform of holding clinical trial related information and in expressing interest in participation
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                Partnering with Industry Leaders, funders, and charities – Diverse partnership and collaborations are
                key to enrich the research ecosystem in India. We are the right platform to attract national and
                international research, encourage innovation partners, join hands with funders and charities all of whom
                are driven by a common goal – Benefit patients/public and boost contribution to the economy
